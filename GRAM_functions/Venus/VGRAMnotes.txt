VenusGRAM and MarsGRAM are available upon request from NASA.

Zipped folder VG2005PC is for Windows, VG2005UN is for Unix systems. 

1. Extract VG2005PC into a directory.
2. Delete all existing executables. We need to build the executables from fortran code. 
3. Install gfortran (e.g. from equation.com), and find its install folder (alternatively, just add the path to Environmental Variables)
4. Build VenusGRAM model by running the following in command prompt:

C\..\VG2005PC>> C:\..\gfortran.exe venusgrm_V05.F venssubs_V05.f SETUP_V05.F

This will build an application (called a.exe by default; another name can be provided using -o flag) that is our executable.

5. Test the build by running test inputs in INPUTREF.txt. First modify the INPUTREF.txt file by
	a.  delete lines: TRAJFL    = 'TRAJDATA.txt' and profile   = 'null'. These are optional.
	b. Provide DATADIR path where VG2005PC is (needs to access datafiles like VIRAMid.txt, VIRALow.txt etc.). Ensure that the address ends with a             backslash, e.g.   DATADIR   = 'D:\Documents\Venus-GRAMMar05\Venus-GRAMMar05\VG2005PC\'  
6. Run test: Either from command line, run a.exe (preferred, since it gives all status information) or run the GUI. A successful test should have a normal exit and generate some new data files, including LIST.txt that should be identical to LISTREF.txt.
