MarsGRAM is much more complicated than VenusGRAM. 

To install MarsGRAM, there is a batch file containing several instructions in Code directory. Several gfortran flags give error with the latest version of gfortran, so remove all flags from IdMarsGRAM.bat (e.g. IdMarsGRAM-original.bat is how it orginally was, before removing the flags).
 
After modifying .bat file, run it from that directory

D:\..\Code>>IdMarsGRAM.bat

This will build the application file and copy into Executables directory. The operations done by the batch file are self-explanatory.

To run MarsGRAM, input files (NAMELIST format) are provided form IOfiles dir. Edit the LSTFL and OUTFL folders as well as DATADIR and GCMDIR addresses - point these 2 to binFiles dir and terminate with backslash. 

MarsGRAM is ready to use!
